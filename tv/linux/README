Summary
=======

This is the Linux port of Miro.  It uses GTK and other GNOME technologies.

Instructions and build requirements are documented at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/LinuxBuildDocs


Requirements
============

There are helper build scripts located in ``tv/linux/helperscripts/``
which will install dependencies for some systems.  Note that these scripts
may be out of date and that you must run them with administrative priveliges.

RUN THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK!  

Please send in patches to the scripts if you encounter issues.

Please send in scripts for systems we don't have scripts for.

If you have problems, visit us on ``#miro-hackers`` on
``irc.freenode.net``.

Generally, the requirements are these:

Build requirements:

* gcc, g++, standard c/c++ libraries - http://gcc.gnu.org/
* Python >= 2.6 - http://www.python.org/ (we don't support Python 3.0 or higher yet)
* Pyrex >= 0.9.6.4 or higher - http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/
* PyGTK >= 2.0 - http://www.pygtk.org/
* pygobject >= 2.0 - http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygobject/
* libwebkit dev files - http://webkit.org/ (might work with lower versions--untested)
* libsoup dev files - http://live.gnome.org/LibSoup 

Runtime requirements:

* Python >= 2.6 - http://www.python.org/ (we don't support Python 3.0 or higher yet)

* pywebkitgtk >= 1.1.5 - http://live.gnome.org/PyWebKitGtk
* libsoup - http://live.gnome.org/LibSoup
* gconf and python bindings
* gstreamer >= 0.10.22 - http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ (needs playbin2 with text-sink)
* gstreamer plugins-base and plugins-good
* gstreamer python bindings
* libtorrent-rasterbar 0.14 or higher except for 0.15.4 which has known issues (bz:13549) - http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/
* libtorrent-rasterbar python bindings

Building and running
====================

To compile and run Miro in the current directory, do::

   ./run.sh

If you have the required dependencies it should build Miro and run it.

See https://develop.participatoryculture.org/projects/dtv/wiki/LinuxBuildDocs
for more information on building and executing the Linux platform code.
The information at this URL is considered the authoritative source.

To run Miro in "debug mode" (i.e. in gdb)::

   ./run.sh --debug

Obviously, this requires gdb.

For more command-line options including how to set preferences on the command 
and what preferences are available, do::

   ./run.sh --help

There are two ways to run Miro in a test sandbox.

1. Set the ``HOME`` environment variable to switch where Miro saves database
   and other files::

      mkdir /tmp/foo
      HOME=/tmp/foo ./run.sh

   This has the problem that it doesn't work if you're using KDE (it causes
   problems) and it uses your "production" Miro configuration.

2. Run Miro using the ``--home`` and ``--gconf-name`` arguments::

      mkdir /tmp/foo
      run.sh --home=/tmp/foo --gconf-name=mirotest

   This stores configuration in a different place and uses a differen home
   without affecting the process environment.


Unittest instructions
=====================

Once you get ``./run.sh`` working, you can run the unittests on Linux
platform.  Do the following::

   ./run.sh --unittest


This will go through all the unittests on the Linux platform and spit out 
any errors to stdout and stderr.


Preferences
===========

Miro stores configuration preferences in gconf.

To see gconf preferences, do::

   gconftool-2 -R /apps/miro

To wipe out all preferences, do::

   gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/miro

To backup your preferences, do::

   gconftool-2 --dump /apps/miro > /tmp/foobar


Problems with gstreamer
=======================

Make sure you have gstreamer plugins installed.  That solves most problems.
Consult your Linux distribution's documentation for details.


Problems with ffmpeg
====================

Miro uses ffmpeg for conversions.  It's common for Linux distributions to
ship with ffmpeg versions that are missing libaac decoding.  If you're
running into problems converting things, that's probably the cause.  Consult
your Linux distribution's documentation for help.
