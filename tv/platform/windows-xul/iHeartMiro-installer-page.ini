Text=Do You Use Firefox?  Help Out!\r\n\r\nIf you use Firefox, you can help support the non-profit that makes Miro by installing this simple Firefox extension.  The extension, called 'I Heart Miro' gives our organization a small referral payment on any purchase you make on Amazon.com.  It doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't track what you buy, and you can remove it easily at any time.
